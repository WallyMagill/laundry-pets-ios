/**
 * PET STATE ENUMERATION
 * 
 * Represents the current state of a laundry pet through the complete wash cycle.
 * This is the core of our gamification system - pets move through these states
 * as users complete real-world laundry tasks.
 * 
 * STATE FLOW:
 * clean ‚Üí dirty ‚Üí washing ‚Üí wetReady ‚Üí drying ‚Üí readyToFold ‚Üí folded ‚Üí clean
 * 
 * DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
 * 1. Each state represents a real laundry task
 * 2. States require user action to progress (gamification)
 * 3. States have visual and emotional feedback
 * 4. Some states are automatic (washing, drying via timers)
 * 5. Abandoned state for severely neglected pets
 * 
 * USER ACTIONS REQUIRED:
 * - dirty ‚Üí washing: "Start Wash"
 * - wetReady ‚Üí drying: "Move to Dryer" 
 * - readyToFold ‚Üí folded: "Fold Me!"
 * - folded ‚Üí clean: "Put Away"
 * - abandoned ‚Üí clean: "Rescue Me!"
