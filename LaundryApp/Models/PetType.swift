/**
 * PET TYPE ENUMERATION
 * 
 * Defines the three distinct types of laundry pets in our app, each representing
 * a different category of household laundry with unique personalities and schedules.
 * 
 * DESIGN PHILOSOPHY:
 * Each pet type represents a real laundry category that users actually have:
 * - Clothes: Daily wear items that need frequent washing
 * - Sheets: Bedding that needs less frequent but regular washing  
 * - Towels: Bathroom items that need moderate washing frequency
 * 
 * PERSONALITY SYSTEM:
 * Each pet type has a distinct personality that affects:
 * - Notification messages (tone and style)
 * - Wash frequency (how often they get dirty)
 * - Timer durations (wash and dry times)
 * - Visual representation (emoji, colors)
