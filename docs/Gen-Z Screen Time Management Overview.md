# Laundry Pets - Project Overview

## Core Vision
Transform the mundane task of laundry management into an engaging, gamified experience through virtual pet care mechanics.

## Target Problem
People consistently fail at laundry management - not just starting loads, but completing the full cycle (wash → dry → fold → put away). Traditional reminder apps focus only on starting tasks.

## Unique Solution
Three distinct virtual pets represent different laundry categories (Clothes, Sheets, Towels), each with personalized schedules and emotional states that evolve through the complete laundry workflow.

## Target Audience
- **Primary**: Ages 18-35, living independently
- **Secondary**: College students, busy professionals, anyone struggling with household routines
- **Psychographics**: People who respond well to gamification, pet/care mechanics, and humor

## Competitive Advantage
- **Complete cycle tracking** (not just wash reminders)
- **Emotional engagement** through pet mechanics
- **Personalized schedules** for different laundry types
- **Humor-first approach** to a mundane task

## Success Metrics
- **Daily Active Users**: 10,000+ within 6 months
- **Task Completion Rate**: 75%+ of started wash cycles completed fully
- **Retention**: 60% monthly retention after 3 months
- **Revenue**: $50K ARR by month 12

## App Store Requirements & Costs
### **Required Costs**
